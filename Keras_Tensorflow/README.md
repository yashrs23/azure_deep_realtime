# Deploy Deep Learning CNN on Kubernetes Cluster with GPUs - Keras

To get started with the tutorial, please proceed with following steps **in sequential order**.

 * [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
 * [Steps](#steps)
 * [Cleaning up](#cleanup)

<a id='prerequisites'></a>
## Prerequisites
1. Linux (x64) with GPU enabled.
2. [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
3. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/linux/docker-ee/ubuntu) installed.
4. [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com).

The tutorial was developed on an [Azure Ubuntu
DSVM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-ubuntu-intro),
which addresses the first three prerequisites.

## Steps
Please follow these steps to set up your environment and run notebooks.  They setup the notebooks to use Docker and Azure seamlessly.

1. Add your user to the docker group: 
   ```
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   newgrp docker
   ```
   To verify whether you have correct configuration, try executing `docker ps` command. You should not get `permission denied` errors.

2. Navigate to the directory which is the framework you have chosen (e.g. Keras_Tensorflow).

3. Create the Python virtual environment using the environment.yml:
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source activate deployment_aml
   ```
5. Login to Azure:
   ```
   az login
   ```
6. If you have more than one Azure subscription, select it:
   ```
   az account set --subscription <Your Azure Subscription>
   ```
7. Start the Jupyter notebook server in the virtual environment:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
8. Select correct kernel: set the kernel to be `Python [conda env: deployment_aml]`(or `Python 3` if that option does not show).

9. After following the setup instructions above, run the Jupyter notebooks in order starting with the first notebook [00_AMLSetup.ipynb](./00_AMLSetup.ipynb).

## Cleaning up
To remove the conda environment created see [here](https://conda.io/projects/continuumio-conda/en/latest/commands/remove.html). The [last Jupyter notebook](./07_TearDown.ipynb)  also gives details on deleting Azure resources associated with this repository.
